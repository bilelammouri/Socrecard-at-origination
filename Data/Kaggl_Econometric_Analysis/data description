Credit Card Data from book "Econometric Analysis"

Context
A small credit card dataset for simple econometric analysis,

Content
card: Dummy variable, 1 if application for credit card accepted, 0 if not
reports: Number of major derogatory reports
age: Age n years plus twelfths of a year
income: Yearly income (divided by 10,000)
share: Ratio of monthly credit card expenditure to yearly income
expenditure: Average monthly credit card expenditure

Notes:
According to Greene (2003, p. 952) dependents equals 1 + number of dependents. That is described above. The authors of the "AER" package in R believe it is the number of dependents. The correct definition is unresolved at this time ¯_(ツ)_/¯
